Selenium is a widely used open-source Web UI(User Interface) automation testing suite. Jason Huggins originally developed it in 2004 as an internal tool at Thought Works. Selenium supports automation across different browsers, platforms, and programming languages. Languages supported by Selenium include C#, Java, Perl, PHP, Python and Ruby
Selenium can automate functional tests and be integrated with automation test tools such as Maven, Jenkins, and Docker to achieve continuous testing. It can also be integrated with tools such as TestNG and JUnit to manage test cases and generate reports.
Automation testing is the best way to increase the effectiveness, efficiency, and coverage of software testing. Steps in the automation testing life cycle are: Test Automation Feasibility Analysis --> Test tool selection --> Determine Scope of Automation Testing --> Planning, Design & Development --> Test Execution --> Maintenance
